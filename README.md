# Flow vs. Typescript
This is just a sandbox app that I used to experiment with various JavaScript technologies. 

My main goal was to compare ES6/Flow and Typescript.

My secondary goals were to experiment with:

* Build tools
* NPM dependency management
* Linting tools
* Unit testing frameworks
* Code coverage tools
* Generating javadoc style documentation for JavaScript
* IDE integration
